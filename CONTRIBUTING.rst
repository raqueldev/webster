First off, thank you for considering contributing to Webster.
Take into account that this project is my very first Python project
and may not be following the best practices, this project has been created as a practice for using Aiven services,
but you are more than Welcome to checkout the project and work on it to improve it, I will learn so much from it.

Actually it would be highly appreciated if someone can take over the testing part. :heart
